        cache certain resources, e.g. downloaded Ruby gems. An admin who wants to
        decrease the size of their blobstore could use this endpoint to delete
        unnecessary blobs.

        This endpoint will delete the buildpack cache for a specified app.
        The buildpack cache is used during staging by buildpacks as a way to
        cache certain resources, e.g. downloaded Ruby gems. A user may want to use this
        endpoint when an app doesnât stage anymore due to out-of-disk caused
        by a large buildpack cache content.
