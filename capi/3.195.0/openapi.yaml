    The Cloud Foundry V3 API is the next generation Cloud Foundry API. It provides a RESTful interface for managing apps, services, organizations, spaces, and all other Cloud Foundry resources.

    ## Key Features
    - RESTful design with consistent patterns
    - OAuth 2.0 authentication via UAA
    - Pagination, filtering, and sorting support
    - Asynchronous operations via jobs
    - Rich metadata support with labels and annotations

    ## Authentication
    All endpoints require a valid OAuth 2.0 bearer token obtained from the UAA server. Include the token in the Authorization header:
    ```
    Authorization: bearer <token>
    ```

    ## Rate Limiting
    API requests may be rate limited. Check the `X-RateLimit-*` response headers for current limits and usage.

    ## Versioning
    This specification documents version 3.195.0 of the Cloud Foundry API.

        cache certain resources, e.g. downloaded Ruby gems. An admin who wants to
        decrease the size of their blobstore could use this endpoint to delete
        unnecessary blobs.

        Download a gzip compressed tarball file containing a Cloud Foundry compatible

        This endpoint downloads the bits of an existing package.
        When using a remote blobstore, such as AWS, the response is a redirect to the actual location of the bits.
        If the client is automatically following redirects, then the OAuth token that was used to communicate
        with Cloud Controller will be replayed on the new redirect request. Some blobstores may reject
        the request in that case. Clients may need to follow the redirect without including the OAuth token.

        This endpoint creates a new role for a user in an organization or space. To create an organization role you must be an admin or organization manager in the organization associated with the role. To create a space role you must be an admin, an organization manager in the parent organization of the space associated with the role, or a space manager in the space associated with the role. For a user to be assigned a space role, the user must already have an organization role in the parent organization. If the associated user is valid but does not exist in Cloud Controller's database, a user resource will be created automatically. If CAPI property  is enabled, the organization role is being created by username + origin and the user does not exist in UAA yet, the user will be created.
        The origin must be different from  in this case.

        Note: User can be specified by guid, username, username_and_origin (see parameter descriptions for details).

        bindings or service route bindings. The service instance is removed from all
        spaces where it is available. User provided service instances do not require interactions with service brokers,
        therefore the API will respond synchronously to the delete request. For managed service instances, the API will respond asynchronously.
        If a service credential binding or service route binding cannot be deleted
        synchronously, then the operation will fail, and the deletion of the binding
        will continue in the background. The operation can be retried until it is successful.

        Creating a user requires one value, a GUID. This creates a user in the Cloud
        Controller database. Generally, the GUID should match the GUID of an already-created user in the
        UAA database, though this is not required.
        Creating a user by guid is only permitted by admins. If CAPI property  is enabled, a UAA user will be automatically created if it does not exist yet.
        The UAA user will be only created when  and  have been provided instead of a guid. Additionally  must be different from .
        Admins and OrgManagers can make use of the UAA user creation.
